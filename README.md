# Diabetes Prediction 

## Overview

Diabetes Prediction is a machine learning project designed to predict the likelihood of diabetes in patients based on various health parameters. The project utilizes a dataset containing medical information and implements a predictive model using Python.

## Features

  Data Preprocessing: Cleaning and preparing the dataset for analysis.
  
  Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualizing data to understand patterns and correlations.
  
  Model Training: Building and training a machine learning model to predict diabetes.
  
  Model Evaluation: Assessing the accuracy and performance of the model.

## Project Structure

  DiabetesPrediction.ipynb: Jupyter notebook containing the code for data preprocessing, EDA, model training, and evaluation.
  
  diabetes.csv: Dataset used for training and testing the model.

## Setup Instructions

  **Clone the Repository:**

  bash

    git clone https://github.com/adityapawar112/DiabetesPredtiction.git

  **Navigate to Project Directory:**

  bash

    cd DiabetesPredtiction

  **Install Dependencies:**
